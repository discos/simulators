.. topic:: Preface

   If you want to know how to write a simulator, how to run the
   tests or how to contribute to this project, then you have to read
   this section.  If you just want to know how to use the simulators
   in order to run your code without the real hardware, then you
   should read the :ref:`user` chapter.

.. todo:: Documentation of custom commands (take care that
   the custom message's bytes must be different than the
   protocol header).
